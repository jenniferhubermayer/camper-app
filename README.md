## Overview

### The Project

Realize the layout of the camper-app. All you have to do is convert the screens from the shortened file including three screens of the app:

- Give your layout a maximum width of 576px
- Don't worry about the functionality of elements, just focus on the design
- The navigation should be fixed at the bottom of the screen
- We can't recreate the image slider yet, so you don't have to worry about that
