# camper-app | Booking-Tool for curated roadtrip places

Super(code) | Interdisciplinary Project | UX/UI-Design Boot-Camp Summer 2022 &amp; Front-End Boot-Camp 2022

The design of this project is a solution for the final project by the members of [Super(code)](https://www.super-code.de/) "UX/UI-Design Boot-Camp Summer 2022". As part of an interdisciplinary project with the Super(Code) "Front-End Boot-Camp 2022" I was building three screens of this project.

## Overview

### The Project

Realize the layout of the camper-app. All you have to do is convert the screens from the shortened file including three screens of the app:

- Give your layout a maximum width of 576px
- Don't worry about the functionality of elements, just focus on the design
- The navigation should be fixed at the bottom of the screen
- We can't recreate the image slider yet, so you don't have to worry about that

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
